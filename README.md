# Keylogger Capturing Strokes Cyber Security Project using Python

## Overview

This project aims to develop a powerful and discreet keylogger tool in Python to enhance cyber security measures. The keylogger captures and records keyboard inputs to gain insights into user behavior and identify potential vulnerabilities. It serves as a valuable resource for improving system defenses, conducting security testing, and enhancing security awareness.

## Features

- Captures and records keystrokes without user knowledge
- Helps identify security vulnerabilities and weaknesses
- Provides valuable data for security testing and analysis
- Enhances protection against unauthorized access and data breaches

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Python and required dependencies.
3. Run the Python script for the keylogger.
4. Monitor the logged keystrokes and analyze the data.

## Prerequisites
